      "Our second day was filled with learning and exploration as we headed to Subic for a tour and official site visits at the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA). We kicked off the day with a briefing session and system demonstrations that gave us insights into how SBMA operates and monitors activities within the Freeport Zone. From real-time surveillance to advanced command centers, the experience was eye-opening.",

      "We then had the opportunity to tour various facilities, interact with the personnel, and observe their daily operations. It was especially exciting to see how technology, security, and administration converge to manage such a dynamic economic zone.",

      "The breathtaking coastal views of Subic and the warm hospitality of the people made the experience even more memorable. This trip not only broadened our understanding of port and zone management but also strengthened our teamwork and appreciation for public service operations.",

      "A big thank you to our guides and the SBMA officials who welcomed us with open arms and shared their knowledge generously.",
